# [Pod Security Policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/)

Pod Security Policies enable fine-grained authorization of pod creation and updates.

A Pod Security Policy is a cluster-level resource that controls security sensitive aspects of the pod specification. The PodSecurityPolicy objects define a set of conditions that a pod must run with in order to be accepted into the system, as well as defaults for the related fields.

## Privileged Policy

[psp-privileged.yaml](./psp-privileged.yaml) - this is the least restricted policy you can create, equivalent to not using the pod security policy admission controller. This policy is applied to `kube-system` namespace.

## Restricted Policy

[psp-restricted.yaml](./psp-restricted.yaml) - this is a restrictive policy that requires users to run as an unprivileged user, blocks possible escalations to root, and requires use of several security mechanisms.

You can description of each field in [Policy Reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#policy-reference).

## RBAC

When a `PodSecurityPolicy` resource is created, it does nothing. In order to use it, the requesting user or target podâ€™s service account must be authorized to use the policy, by allowing the use verb on the policy.

- [rbac-privileged.yaml](./rbac-privileged.yaml) allows to use `psp-02-privileged` policy in `kube-system` namespace.
- [rbac-restricted.yaml](./rbac-restricted.yaml) allows to use `psp-01-restricted` policy in all namespaces with default service account.

You can find more details about RBAC auth and policies [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#authorizing-policies).

List all pod security policies:

```bash
kubectl get psp
```

Run `kubectl apply` on `psp` directory to apply pod security policies and RBAC configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f psp
```

## [Security Context](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/)

A security context defines privilege and access control settings for a Pod or Container.

`securityContext` field in a deployment is required to comply with restricted security policy. You can use any numeric value except 0:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ .Values.appName }}
  namespace: {{ .Values.namespace }}
spec:
  replicas: {{ .Values.replicas }}
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: {{ .Values.appName }}
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: {{ .Values.appName }}
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1000
```

## GKE Configuration

Pod Security Policy support is enabled by default in [gke_cluster](../../modules/gke_cluster/main.tf) Terraform module:

```ruby
  pod_security_policy_config {
    enabled = true
  }
```
